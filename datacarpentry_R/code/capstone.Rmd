Create a histogram of hindfoot lengths.
```{r}
ggplot(sv, aes(x=hindfoot_length))+geom_histogram(bins=8)
```

Create a scatterplot of hindfoot length vs weight for the species "DM", "DO", and "DS". Use different colors for the three species, and put the three species in different panels.
```{r}
p<-sv %>% filter(species_id%in%c("DM", "DO","DS"))
ggplot(p, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) + geom_point(aes(color=species_id))
```

Create a table of counts of "DM" by plot type for the year 1977.
```{r}
sv %>% filter(species_id=="DM", year==1977) %>%group_by(plot_id) %>%  tally

```
Create a line plot of the counts of "DM" in "Rodent Exclosure" plots over time.
